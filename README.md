Code to generate figures from Brian Romanchuk's books

Notes: 2019-06-11

Almost all of the code here is expected to be R code. It is based on the *econ_platform* package for Python and *R*, and uses the *R* library code found in the legacy/R subfolder. There are probably better ways to use *R*, but I have not invested the time to get make my R code cleaner.

Note that this package only includes code for figures found in books published after the development of the *econ_platform* package (which is my manuscript on recessions). 

Unless I change my work style, I keep my SFC model code in the examples directory of the *sfc_models* package.

There is no attempt to document anything here; I am just putting this out as a convenience for anyone who wants to replicate my charts (and prove me wrong!) and as an open source backup. Also, I have hard-coded paths that work on my computer, and/or code is Windows-specific. In other words, although people could use this code as an examples to get started with their own work, this is not an easy-to-install public package.
